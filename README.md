# 🌿 TheDruidsHarvest - FASTAPI (WIP)🍂

Welcome to **TheDruidsHarvest.FASTAPI**, a simple project created to explore the magic of FastAPI in web development. This repository serves as a learning ground for building fast, lightweight, and scalable APIs using one of Python's most efficient frameworks.

---

## 🌱 **Project Overview**
This project is a hands-on exploration of FastAPI, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of creating modern web APIs. It covers the basics of:

- 🛠️ FastAPI setup and configuration
- ⚡ Creating asynchronous API endpoints
- 🌐 Handling requests and responses
- 🔐 Basic security and authentication features
- 📚 API documentation and interactive exploration with Swagger UI
